with the interpretation of AI, facemask detection technology is used to monitor social distancing and even to identify the usage of face masks To reduce the spread of the Corona epidemic 


I created a Machine Learning Model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is trained on a Masks and not masks face images and Transfer learning (
MobileNet V2
MobileNet V2 is a model developed by Google.
It is trained on the ImageNet dataset, a large dataset of 1.4M images and 1000 classes.)
, for anyone who may not know, is nothing more than adapting a pre-trained model (ideally from a similar problem context â€” in this case, image classification) that was trained on a larger dataset. When working with relatively limited data, this can lead to stronger overall models.
In this repository, I created a Machine Learning Model using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) that is trained on a Masks and not masks face images, then I performed real time Detection using OpenCV Library after loading my model.
